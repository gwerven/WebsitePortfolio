        <h1>Survey: Academic Interests of Clover High School Students</h1>
        <p>An AP Statistics project by Vivian Karamitros and Garrett Erven</p>
        <p>December 14th, 2016</p>
        <hr style="color: red"/>
        <h2>Introduction/Type of Research</h2>
        <p>A survey was conducted to answer the central research question: Are students content with the classes offered and the graduation requirements at Clover High School? The research question was chosen because the results of the survey could allow Clover High School’s faculty/staff to better serve their student population possibly by offering new courses that the students want or by eliminating or lessening the importance of courses that they do not show much interest in. The results of the survey may possibly lead to real life change if shown to the right people.</p>

            <h2>Hypothesis/Background Information</h2>
            <p>It was believed that about 20% of the CHS student population would not be content with the variety of AP courses currently offered by CHS (*the overwhelming majority of CHS students do not enroll in AP courses and therefore would probably be content with the AP courses currently offered). However, it is also believed that some students may not have enrolled in an AP course simply because the course they desired was not offered by CHS, and they likely noted that they are discontent with the current AP courses offered. AP Psychology was believed to be one of the most requested AP courses followed by AP European History. The expected responses to the next 2 questions (the most essential and least essential course in a high school education) were believed to favor math and english courses and disfavor foreign language, fine arts, and physical education courses. More specifically, it was expected that about 80% of participants would consider foreign language courses to be the least essential to a high school education. It was also expected that about 40% of participants would consider math the most essential to a high school education and another 40% of participants to consider English the most essential course to a high school education. The remaining 20% would consist of the other courses. The fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth questions (yes, no, and rating of 1-5 questions) were expected to share a pattern of about 50% of participants answering yes (a computer science/fine arts/physical education/personal health/personal finance  course should be necessary for graduation requirements) and the other 50% answering no (a computer science/fine arts/physical education/personal health/personal finance course should not be necessary for graduation requirements). The 1-5  rating questions were expected to follow the same pattern with equal amounts of people agreeing and disagreeing with the statements given (split down the middle averaging about a 3 for each of the questions). It was believed that about 50% of respondents would consider physics a course that should be eliminated from the CHS curriculum, and about 60% of respondents to consider agricultural/animal science a course that deserves honors weighting with health science being another common option.
                <br/><br/>*According to the 2016 CHS School Profile, only 314 of the 2,240 (approximately 14%) students at Clover High School enrolled in an AP course.</p>

            <h2>Which AP courses do you wish Clover High School offered?</h2>
            <img src="res/images/desiredapcourses.png" width="787" height="400" alt="Desired AP Courses">
            <p>About 37% (10 of 27) of students surveyed wished CHS offered AP Psychology. Contrary to the hypothesis, 87.8% (21 of 27) of students surveyed were not content with the current AP courses offered at CHS, whereas the hypothesis stated only 20% of students would be discontent with the AP courses offered. However, the hypothesis was correct in stating that AP Psychology would be the most requested AP course at CHS. Several AP courses only had one student (3.7% each course) supporting its introduction into the course curriculum, such as AP Physics C: Mechanics, AP Chinese Language, AP German Language, AP Japanese Language, and AP Spanish Literature. AP World History was among the most requested courses with 18.5% (5 students) of students surveyed supporting its introduction into the CHS curriculum, as well as AP European History (11.1% or 3 students), AP Macroeconomics (11.1% or 3 students), and AP Italian Language (11.1% or 3 students).</p>

            <img src="res/images/mostessentialcourses.png" width="594" height="400" alt="Most Essential Courses">
            <p>About 18.5% (5 of 27 students) of students surveyed believed biology to be the most essential course to a high school education and 18.5% (5 of 27 students) also said that English is the most essential course to a high school education. Only 7.4% (2 of 27) of students surveyed believed mathematics is the most essential course to a high school education, contradicting the hypothesis expecting 40% of students to believe mathematics to be the most essential high school course. Similarly, 18.5% (5 of 27) of students surveyed think English is the most essential high school course, contradicting the hypothesis expecting 40% of students to believe English to be the most essential course.</p>

            <img src="res/images/leastessentialcourses.png" width="594" height="400" alt="Least Essential Courses">
            <p>About 25.9% (7 of 27) of students surveyed believed art to be the least essential course to a high school education, while 22.2% (6 of 27) of students surveyed believe physical education to be the least essential course to a high school education. Contradicting the hypothesis expecting 80% of students surveyed to reply that foreign language is the least essential course to a high school education, only 3.7% (1 of 27) of students surveyed think foreign language is the least essential course to a high school education. More students surveyed believed U.S History (7.4% or 2 of 27) and Algebra (7.4% or 2 of 27) to be the least essential courses to a high school education. A large proportion of students surveyed (18.5% or 5 of 27) believe Precalculus/Trigonometry is the least essential course to a high school education.</p>
            
            <h2>Do you think Clover High School students should be required to complete a computer science course in order to graduate?</h2>
            <img src="res/images/computerscience.png" width="593" height="400" alt="Computer Science Course">
            <p>Approximately 66.7% (18 of 27) of students surveyed believed a computer science course should be a CHS graduation requirement, while 33.3% (9 of 27) of students surveyed do not believe computer science should be a CHS graduation requirement.</p>
            
            <h2>Do you think Clover High School students should be required to complete a fine arts course in order to graduate?</h2>
            <img src="res/images/finearts.png" width="594" height="400" alt="Fine Arts Course">
            <p>Approximately 51.9% (14 of 27) of students surveyed believed a fine arts course should be a CHS graduation requirement, while 48.1% (13 of 27) of students surveyed do not believe a fine arts course should be a CHS graduation requirement.</p>
            
            <h2>Do you think Clover High School students should be required to complete a physical education/personal finance/personal health course in order to graduate?</h2>
            <img src="res/images/graduationrequirements.png" width="595" height="400" alt="Graduation Requirements">
            <p>1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree</p>
            <p>If a student at CHS were picked at random, it would be more likely for the student to strongly disagree than strongly agree that PE should be a graduation requirement, which explains why the box and whisker plot is skewed to the right. Seventy-five percent of students surveyed did not strongly agree that PE should be a graduation requirement, whereas 25% of students surveyed strongly disagree that PE should be a graduation requirement. The median level of agreement is 4, which means agree, but not strongly agree. The middle 50% levels of agreement from surveyed students are between 1 and 4, from strongly disagree to agree. 
                If a student at CHS were picked at random, it would be more likely for the student to strongly agree than strongly disagree that personal finance should be a graduation requirement, which explains why the box and whisker plot is skewed to the left. Not one student surveyed strongly disagreed that personal finance should be a graduation requirement. Twenty-five percent of students surveyed either disagreed with the statement or showed neutral feelings toward the statement, while another 25% of the students surveyed strongly agreed that personal finance should be a graduation requirement. The middle 50% levels of agreement from surveyed students are between 3 to 5, from neutral to strongly agree. The median level of agreement is 4, which means agree, but not strongly agree.

                If a student at CHS were picked at random, it would be more likely for the student to strongly agree than strongly disagree that Personal Health should be a graduation requirement at CHS, which explains why the box and whisker plot is skewed to the left.  Fifty percent of students surveyed agreed, were neutral, disagreed, or strongly disagreed that Personal Health should be a graduation requirement, but 50% of students surveyed strongly agreed that Personal Health should be a graduation requirement. Twenty-five percent of students surveyed either strongly disagree or disagree that personal health should be a graduation requirement, while the middle 50% of agreement levels ranged from disagree to strongly agree. The median level of agreement is 4, which means agree. 

                Looking at comparative graph, it is evident that CHS students believe personal finance and personal health should be graduation requirements, whereas they believe physical education should not be a graduation requirement. The demand for personal finance (which currently is not a graduation requirement) to become one is strong (the middle 50% of responses ranged from neutral to strongly agree).</p>
            
            <h2>Which course should be eliminated from the Clover High School curriculum?</h2>
            <img src="res/images/eliminatedcourse.png" width="696" height="400" alt="Eliminated Course">
            <p>The greatest amount of students (18.52% or 5 of 27) believe that no course should be removed from the CHS curriculum. An equal amount of students (18.52% or 5 of 27) believe that PE should be removed from the CHS curriculum. No other class shows significant interest for elimination by CHS students, though Art and US History follow behind with 7.41% (2 of 27) votes.</p>
            
            <h2>Which College Preparatory course should be given Honors weighting?</h2>
            <img src="res/images/honorsweightedcourse.png" width="669" height="400" alt="Honors Weighted Course">
            <p>Spanish 2 leads the courses that students believe should be given honors weighting by 14.81% (4 of 27). Algebra, Animal Science, Sociology, and None follow closely behind with 11.11% (3 of 27) each. Geometry, Computer Programming, and Agricultural Science remain with 7.41% (2 of 27) each.</p>
            
            <h2>Statistical Significance/Comparison to Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>Contrary to the hypothesis, 87.8% (21 of 27) of students surveyed were not content with the AP courses offered at CHS, whereas the hypothesis expected only 20% of students would be discontent with the AP courses offered. However, the hypothesis was correct in stating that AP Psychology would be the most requested AP course by CHS students. Only 7.4% (2 of 27) of students surveyed believed mathematics to be the most essential course in high school, contradicting the hypotheses expectation that 40% of students would believe mathematics to be the most essential high school course. Similarly, 18.5% (5 of 27) of students surveyed believed English to be the most essential high school course, contradicting the hypotheses expectation that 40% of students would believe English to be the most essential high school course. Contradicting the hypotheses expectation that 80% of students surveyed would believe foreign language to be the least essential course to a high school education, only 3.7% (1 of 27) of students surveyed believe foreign language to be the least essential high school course. Approximately 66.7% (18 of 27) of students surveyed believe computer science should be a graduation requirement, while 33.3% (9 of 27) don’t, contradicting the hypotheses expectation of a 50/50 distribution between those believing the course should be a requirement and those believing the course should not be a requirement.
                Some results are statistically significant because the large difference between the expectations of the hypothesis and the responses cannot be attributed simply to randomization alone, but some results were not statistically significant. The large difference between the hypothesized percentages and actual percentages can be attributed to uncontrollable bias. An example of one group of results that is statistically significant are the 87.8% (21 of 27) of students surveyed who were not content with the AP courses currently offered at CHS, whereas the hypothesis expected only 20% of students would be discontent with the AP courses offered. On the other hand, 51.9% (14 of 27) of students surveyed believe a fine arts course should be a CHS graduation requirement, while 48.1% (13 of 27) of students surveyed do not, and the hypothesis states there would be a 50/50 distribution. Therefore, these results are not statistically significant.</p>
            
            <h2>Conclusions/Representation of Population/Effects on Society</h2>
            <p>Significantly more students than expected are interested in enrolling in AP courses if the ones they desired were offered at CHS. Three AP courses were of particularly high demand: AP Psychology, AP World History, and AP European History (this may be because CHS currently offers mostly math and science AP courses, leading students to desire more history and social science courses). Students also believe biology, English, and economics courses to be the most essential to a high school education and art, PE, and trigonometry/pre-calculus to be the least essential courses to a high school education. More students than not agree that a computer science course should be a graduation requirement, whereas the support for and against a fine arts course as a graduation requirement is split about 50/50. More students disagree that a PE course should be a graduation requirement, whereas more students agree that a personal finance course should be a graduation requirement. Based on the academic interests of the students of CHS, we suggest increasing the selection of AP courses to include AP Psychology, AP World History, and AP European History. We also suggest eliminating art and PE as graduation requirements, (simply making them optional) and making a personal finance course a newly introduced graduation requirement. It is also within the interest of CHS students to keep a computer science course as a graduation requirement. Finally, we suggest that Spanish 2 gain honors weighting because many of CHS’s most ambitious and talented students desire honors credit for this required class to improve their GPA. We believe that the majority of the statistical results of our survey represent the CHS student population fairly because we administered the survey in a viable fashion. Some of the results, however, may have been influenced by uncontrollable bias explained on the errors/changes slide.</p>
            
            <h2>Errors/Changes</h2>
            <p>The best change that could be made to ensure that the survey is a representative sample of the CHS student population is to have more participants complete the survey. This would reduce the nonresponse bias present in the results. Another possible change that could be made is to ensure that no majority of the teachers selected to participate in the survey instruct classes of similar/identical subjects. It may have been beneficial to stratify the participants in the survey based on the subject of the class they were currently enrolled in. It could've been beneficial to add a final question to the end of the survey asking which class they are currently in while taking the survey to stratify in this way.</p>
